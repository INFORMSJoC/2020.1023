# Data for replication

Here is the data needed for replicating the experiments. 

`college_student_enroll-s1-1.csv` contains the 20,000 randomly generated student records for training predictive models.

`college_applications6000.csv` contains 6,000 student application records. We randomly draw certain number of records from this pool for our experiments in the paper.
