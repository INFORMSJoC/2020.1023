# Code for replication

Here is the code needed for replicating the experiments. 

`rewrite_08_20200430_s1.py` is for comparing JANOS_Discrete, JANOS_CONTINUOUS, and a greedy heuristic when using logistic regression models and neural networks respectively.

`evaluate_linearize_logistic_20200430.py` is for evaluating the accuracy of the linearization component for logistic regression models.

`evaluate_linear_regression_20200430.py` is for evaluating the performance of JANOS at solving various-sized problems when using linear regression models.

`evaluate_logistic_regression_20200430.py` is for evaluating the performance of JANOS at solving various-sized problems when using logistic regression models.

`evaluate_neural_network_20200430.py` is for evaluating the performance of JANOS at solving various-sized problems when using neural networks.
